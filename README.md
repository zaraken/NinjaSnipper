# NinjaSnipper
nifty tool for screenshots on Windows

What makes this a particularly good tool

1. Able to select part of the screen with your mouse and save it to a file and/or copy it to the clipboard.
2. Also detect pressing the PrintScreen key and save the clipboard contents to a file.
3. Save the screenshots automatically to some predefined location with a default image format (not open a dialog every time, nor an editor)
4. However be able to specify a different location and image format every now and then.
5. No GUI. I wanted it to run in the background (in this case, the system tray).
6. Activate it via keyboard shortcut. It is a deal breaker if you have to navigate to the app for every screenshot, when you are making a lot of them.
7. Work on multiple monitors!
